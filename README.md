# aoc2023

These are my 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

- Each day is it's own workspace (allows for isolated or shared crates to be used)
- Each day should have at least one unit test setup

example of testing a single day:
`cargo test -p day_1`

example of testing all days:
`cargo test`
