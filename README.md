# aoc2023

These are my 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

- Each day is it's own workspace (allows for isolated or shared crates to be used)
- Each day should have at least one unit test setup
  - to check all days, run: `cargo test`
- Each day should also simply print it's own answer to the terminal

example of running a single day:
`cargo run -p day_1`
